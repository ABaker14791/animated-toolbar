## About

I made a copy of a toolbar design made in figma, the toolbar opens on click and has animation for each tool that is selected

## What can I improve on?

One thing missing from the original design is the box shadow used, I struggled to implement this because of the way i used an ::after psudo css element for the animated indent, the clip path I used for this is ontop of the toolbar so adding a shadow to it was not possible.

## What did I learn?

I learned that css psudo classed are not part of the DOM, I had to use a few hacks and work-arounds, if I had known this I would have probably taken a different apprach to the indented animation.
